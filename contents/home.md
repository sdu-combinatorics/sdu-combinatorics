### <a id="extremal-and-probabilistic-combinatorics"></a>Extremal and Probabilistic Combinatorics
Our research in this area focuses on extremal structures and probabilistic thresholds in discrete systems.

- **Extremal problems in graphs and hypergraphs**, including Turán-type and stability problems.  
  *Representative work:*  
  - *Title of Paper 1*, Journal / arXiv, Year.  
  - *Title of Paper 2*, Journal / arXiv, Year.

- **Probabilistic methods and random structures**, such as random graphs, phase transitions, and threshold phenomena.  
  *Representative work:*  
  - *Title of Paper 3*, Journal / arXiv, Year.

### <a id="graph-theory-and-discrete-mathematics"></a>Graph Theory and Discrete Mathematics
We study structural and algorithmic properties of graphs and related discrete objects.

- **Structural graph theory**, including connectivity, expansion, and decomposition.  
  *Representative work:*  
  - *Title of Paper 4*, Journal / arXiv, Year.

- **Discrete structures and applications**, including combinatorial designs and discrete geometry.  
  *Representative work:*  
  - *Title of Paper 5*, Journal / arXiv, Year.

### <a id="combinatorial-optimization"></a>Combinatorial Optimization
Our work addresses optimization problems on discrete structures, with both theoretical and algorithmic perspectives.

- **Approximation and exact algorithms** for classical combinatorial optimization problems.  
  *Representative work:*  
  - *Title of Paper 6*, Journal / arXiv, Year.

- **Optimization on graphs and networks**, including matching, flow, and covering problems.  
  *Representative work:*  
  - *Title of Paper 7*, Journal / arXiv, Year.
