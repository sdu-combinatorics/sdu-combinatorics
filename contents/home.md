Welcome to the homepage of the **SDU Combinatorics Group**, led by **[Prof. Guanghui Wang](https://faculty.sdu.edu.cn/wangguanghui1/zh_CN/index.htm)**.

## Research Interests
Our research focuses on both the **fundamental theory of combinatorics** and its connections to related areas, including:

### Extremal and Probabilistic Combinatorics

### Graph Theory and Discrete Mathematics

### Combinatorial Optimization

## Conjectures
We propose and investigate several conjectures in combinatorics and related fields, including:
