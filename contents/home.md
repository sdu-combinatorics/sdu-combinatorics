Welcome to my homepage!  
I am currently a Professor at the School of Mathematics, <strong>Shandong University</strong>.  
Before joining Shandong University, I was a Professor at <strong>[École Centrale Paris](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/histoire)</strong>, and earlier a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Laboratory of Applied Mathematics, École Centrale Paris.  
I obtained my Ph.D. in Mathematics from [Shandong University](https://www.math.sdu.edu.cn/) and <strong>[Université Paris-Sud (Paris-Saclay)](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/)</strong> in 2015, supervised by <strong>[Guizhen Liu](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%88%98%E6%A1%82%E7%9C%9F/2050334)</strong> and <strong>[Hao Li](https://www.lri.fr/~li/)</strong>.
