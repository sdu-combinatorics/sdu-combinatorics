Welcome to my homepage!  
I am currently a Professor at the School of Mathematics, Shandong University.  
Before joining Shandong University, I was a Professor at École Centrale Paris, and earlier a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Laboratory of Applied Mathematics, École Centrale Paris.  
I obtained my Ph.D. in Mathematics from Shandong University and Université Paris-Sud (Paris-Saclay) in 2015, supervised by Guizhen Liu and [[Hao Li]](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PpQ96CEAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN).
