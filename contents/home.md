Welcome to my homepage!  
I am currently a Professor at the School of Mathematics, Shandong University.  
Before joining Shandong University, I was a Professor at [École Centrale Paris](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/histoire), and earlier a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Laboratory of Applied Mathematics, École Centrale Paris.  
I obtained my Ph.D. in Mathematics from [Shandong University](https://www.math.sdu.edu.cn/) and [Université Paris-Sud (Paris-Saclay)](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/) in 2015, supervised by [Guizhen Liu](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%88%98%E6%A1%82%E7%9C%9F/2050334) and [Hao Li](https://www.lri.fr/~li/).
