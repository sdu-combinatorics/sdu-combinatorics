  *Representative work:*  
  - *Title of Paper 1*, Journal / arXiv, Year.  
  - *Title of Paper 2*, Journal / arXiv, Year.

- <span class="news-tag conference">**Probabilistic methods and random structures**</span>, such as random graphs, phase transitions, and threshold phenomena.  
  *Representative work:*  
  - *Title of Paper 3*, Journal / arXiv, Year.
